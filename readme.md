## Project

This Repo currently has two working scripts. 
- 1. SpotBitcoinPythonScript.py gets the current spot price of BTC-USD and creates a .csv file on your PC. Pulls the spot bitcoin price from the Coinbase API.
- 2. BTCHistoricalPrice.py is a script that allows you to enter a historical date, and get the going spot BTC-USD price for that date.
